# OnlinePharmacyWebsite
A repository for an online pharmacy website with back-end support.

This repository here contains all the files and code related to a website project I had made. 
Web Development has always fascinated me. It gives a medium to show your creativeness and the ability to bring into existence beautiful Websites. Additionally, to make it work along with good Front End, we require a well coded and thought of Back End. According to me, a good Back End is what differentiates a diamond of a  website from the proverbial coal mine. 
By uploading this project, I hope to inspire fellow students and anyone else who has an appreciation of website development to go out there and try making various beautiful and intricate websites. This project can serve as an example to study from or a starting point for the beginners. I have also included earlier versions of the project to help further facilitate the idea of this repository being an example for the beginners in Web Design. These are divided in the main path through different folders which have self explainatory names.

# The website is designed to be an online pharmacy complete with back end support.
# Overview of the project:

Front End Languages:  XHTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3 and a little bit of Bootstrap.

Back End Languages: PHP, JavaScript and SQL.

Tried and tested on XAMPP local server.

Sports Login and SignUp features.

Interactive webpages.

Medicine Searching by Name.

Database connectivity (SQL).

exclusive features only for logged in users like Order Placement, Personalized Bill Printing,etc.

All the above features have appropriate Validations on each of them and also have Error Messages which help the user identify what went wrong in his/her submission (which are implemented through PHP and JavaScript).

In the later time, I will update the repository to include the SQL codes I had ran on the XAMPP to initiate and populate my database.
Till then go and get your hands dirty in some web designing :) 
As always,
